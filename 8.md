tall cargo and Rust in case you don't have it. This command is for Linux or MacOS.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

Add the wasm32-unknown-unknown toolchain

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zavodil/near-staking-pool-owner
```

Compile smart contract

```bash
cd near-staking-pool-owner/contract
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

Deploy smart contract on your owner account. Adjust the path to .wasm file if required.

replace xx with your wallet name

```bash
NEAR_ENV=shardnet near deploy xx.shardnet.near --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm
```

Initialize the smart contract picking accounts for splitting revenue.

Ganti xx dengan nama wallet kalian, xx1 bisa isi nama wallet saya(coyote.shardnet.near)/teman kalian, untuk xx2 bisa isi nama wallet kalian sendiri

```bash
CONTRACT_ID=xx.shardnet.near

# Change numerator and denomitor to adjust the % for split.
near call $CONTRACT_ID new '{"staking_pool_account_id": "xx.factory.shardnet.near", "owner_id":"xx.shardnet.near", "reward_receivers": [["xx1.shardnet.near", {"numerator": 3, "denominator":10}], ["xx2.shardnet.near", {"numerator": 70, "denominator":100}]]}' --accountId $CONTRACT_ID
```

Contoh 

```bash
CONTRACT_ID=coyote.shardnet.near

# Change numerator and denomitor to adjust the % for split.
near call $CONTRACT_ID new '{"staking_pool_account_id": "coyote.factory.shardnet.near", "owner_id":"coyote.shardnet.near", "reward_receivers": [["smartinvest.shardnet.near", {"numerator": 3, "denominator":10}], ["coyote.shardnet.near", {"numerator": 70, "denominator":100}]]}' --accountId $CONTRACT_ID
```

Wait until you start receiving rewards on your node staking pool. Do a withdraw of rewards.

xx ganti nama wallet kalian

```bash
CONTRACT_ID=xx.shardnet.near
NEAR_ENV=shardnet near call $CONTRACT_ID withdraw '{}' --accountId $CONTRACT_ID --gas 200000000000000
```
